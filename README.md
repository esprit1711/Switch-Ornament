# Switch-Ornament
tinyest possible Gif Player that looks like a Nintendo Switch
IN CASE YOU WANT TO BUILD YOUR OWN SWITCH ORNAMENT, PLEASE CONTACT ME. I WANT TO FIX SOME TINY PROBLEMS WITH THE BOARD IN VERSION 1.4 :)

Here, you will find everything to Copy my GIF Player, that looks like a Nintendo Switch. This Project use a 0.96" 80x160 Pixel TFT with st7735 Driver.
The Source Code is based on the "ESP32-LGFX-SDCard-GifPlayer" Example of the "AnimatedGIF" library from "bitbank2".
The Inspiration for this Project is the Nintendo Switch Ornamend from scottbez1 (you can find his Video in der Credits). He use a slightly bigger Screen, with much higher Resolution but i want the smalest possible Switch.

Part of this Project is a DIY Powerbank only for this device so you can use it as a christmas ornament. Powerbank and Switch are connected over a 65cm long cable with 0.04mmÂ² wires. to achive also the tinyest possible powerbank, i crated a custom Board with Li-Po Charger and Power Switch (you can charge the battery and can still use the device). To use the powerbank also as base, i put 3 magnets inside the switch case and powerbank so it will hold very well together without any bad looking mechanic

The Mainboard is optimised to be ordered at jlcpcb and use the assembly Service. You will find everything jlcpcb need (gerber, BOM and positions file) in the "production" Folder of the KiCad Project. You want to choose a 1.6mm board thickness, the Option "Specify a location" at "Remove Order Number" and check the orientation of every part after upload and check the BOM. You also need to order the tiny Buttons and the TFT so you can assemble it after you got the Boards.

After everything is assembled, you need to prepare a USB Cable so the connection will match with the silkscreen. You can solder it directly on the Pads, or use a 1.27mm pinheader. Solder the "BOOT" bridge at the front of the board, connect the USB cable to your PC, open the Firmware with Arduino IDE and upload the Code.
To upload the code, you need to copy the library folder in your local Arduino library folder and install the ESP32 via Board Manager. after you prepared this, you just need to choose the right board (ESP32C3 Dev Module) and Port and set every setting like on the following picture:

After a successful upload, disconnect the USB cable and remove the "BOOT" solder bridge. Now, you dont need to solder the Bridge anymore to upload a Code via USB. You can also disconnect the USB Cable (or leave it, if you want to use it as the power source) and power the device via the +5V and GND Pads. The Software is prepared to update the firmware, if a "SO_update.bin" was found on the SD-Card, so in case of an Update, you dont need the USB connection anymore.

The Case for the powerbank is printed with an FDM 3D Printer. You need 3x M2 Threaded inserts and M2x6mm screws to assemble everything. As a battery, i use 402535 320mAh LiPo. A piece of double sieded tape between the battery and board is recommended.

The magnets i use are 2mm x 1mm (diameter x thickness). Use a pen to mark the polarity, so you know everytime the orientation.

The Case for the Nintendo Switch is printed with an Resin Printer. I had to do some tests to find the perfect dimensions, but now everything should fit very well.
Paint can bring some thickness, so be carefull with to mouch Paint.

Changelog:
1.1:
- Support for alternative ST7735 Displays (if Color ist wrong, try GPIO09 connect to VCC (alternative Display Type))

1.2:
- Check for GIF Header. Ignor file if Header ist not "GIF"
- alternative library (chose before compile code)

1.3:
- PNG support
- Left Button trigger play previous file instead of changing the Brightness of the Screen

1.4:
- Clean Code, so it should be now better to maintain
- Fix a problem when use the LGFX library (use a variable from eSPI to initialise the SD Card (old testing stuff))
- improve Version Information and SD Card Info Screen. Its now cleaner and stay for 2 instead of 1 second
- change brightness level by push and hold left (reduce) or right (increase) button for more than 1 second
- speed up initialisation slightly
