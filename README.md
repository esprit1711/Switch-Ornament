# Switch-Ornament
tinyest possible Gif Player that looks like a Nintendo Switch

Here, you will find everything to Copy my GIF Player, that looks like a Nintendo Switch. This Project use a 0.96" 80x160 Pixel TFT with st7735 Driver.
The Source Code is based on the "ESP32-LGFX-SDCard-GifPlayer" Example of the "AnimatedGIF" library from "bitbank2".
The Inspiration for this Project is the Nintendo Switch Ornamend from scottbez1. He use a slightly bigger Screen, with much higher Resolution but i want the smalest possible Switch.

Part of this Project is a DIY Powerbank only for this device so you can use it as a christmas ornament. Powerbank and Switch are connected over a 65cm long cable with 0.04mmÂ² wires. to achive also the tinyest possible powerbank, i crated a custom Board with Li-Po Charger and Power Switch (you can charge the battery and can still use the device). To use the powerbank also as base, i put 3 magnets inside the switch case and powerbank so it will hold very well together without any bad looking mechanic
